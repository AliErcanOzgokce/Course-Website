                    The Internet is littered with excellent content about Web 3. With that said, the majority of what you find online is superficial. It’s written by content marketers who are paid for mass appeal and quantity, not quality. Many of them are paid by the word, which means they have an incentive to rant and ramble. Even if they give you the “right answer,” it’s not worth very much without the structure and support needed to implement what you learn. Rather than spending years of your precious life searching for and reading those articles, you will find the best information distilled here into a coherent and actionable framework. Better yet, you’ll have a community of Web 3 experts and enthusiasts who can support you emotionally and intellectually.                    </p>
